## NPC Appearance Mod v 3.0
* Renamed to NPC Appearance Mod to be more general
* Added Sally
  * You may change many features about her appearance similar to Angela
  * Custom made and textured a long hair mesh
  * Her textures have been completely remade asymmetrically and are **not** compatible with base textures
  * Added a red Sally inspired by original concept art https://x.com/kis_soft/status/1704983793067831685
* Moved many parts into a general class, and put character specific things into character controller classes
* Completely refactored how textures are loaded
* Breasts now jiggle less as they become smaller, to no jiggle. Though they still move some with animations
* Added this changelog to the zip file as I meant to last time, whoops

## AngelaBoobs v 2.0
* Added the ability to toggle her skirt off
* Added pussy mesh and texture, general texture improvement
* Added the ability to change textures at runtime via a dropdown in the settings menu
  * Added Goth Angela textures by FunfettiPhantom and slightly edited by me as example texture mod
  * **Issue:** Face textures do not change. If you could help me out with this that would be great
* Removed NippleGone slider, because...
* Added some blending around her nipple textures. If you increase the nipple size a lot they still look like they clip through but it's a lot better now imo
* Added thigh thickness blendshape and ass size blendshape to body
* Added option to flatten or remove nipples when she's wearing a top
